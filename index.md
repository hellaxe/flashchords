# What is FlashChords?
**FlashChords** is an application for memorizing chords, which works similarly to flashcards, showing cards with a note or chord to play.

# Who is this for?
Do you want to familiarize yourself with scales and chords, play any progression in any key, or use inversions with ease? Then this app is for you.
**Note**: It is strongly suggested that you already be familiar with the basics of musical theory and know how scales and chords are built.

# Requirements
It is highly recommended to have a **MIDI** device that can connect to iPhone/iPad via **Bluetooth**. Or, if you have an iPad, you can use a **USB MIDI** device.
In case you don't have such a device, you can use a piano or simply test yourself without an instrument.

## Interactive Mode
*Interactive Mode* is enabled when a MIDI device is connected to the iPhone/iPad. In this case, there will be a green circle icon in the main menu near *"Setup MIDI Device".*
*Interactive Mode* is used for checking the completion of tasks automatically.

## Non-interactive Mode
If you don't have a compatible MIDI device, the application will work in *Non-interactive Mode*. In *Non-interactive Mode*, tasks will be swapped over time, which you can set up in settings. Also, you can enable the ability to tap to swap tasks.
If youâ€™re using *Non-interactive Mode*, you should be more careful when playing because the app will not provide any feedback.

## Exercises
In the current version of the application, all exercises are divided by keys. It is recommended to proceed in the default order of the keys and complete them step by step.
Each scale exercise is divided into 4 categories:
* Scale
* Triads
* Seventh chords
* Refresh the memory

*Scale* exercises will help you familiarize yourself with notes on the major scale.
*Triad and seventh chord* exercises will help you to learn the chords of scales as well as movements and hand placement.
*Refresh the memory* exercises contain the chords of the current and previous scales.
